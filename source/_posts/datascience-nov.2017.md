For the coming November, we are happy to have Carousell to share more on the data science work they are working on.

### Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning at Carousell

### Joint deep image and language understanding (dot product model, deep CNNs) by Matthew Henderson

Carousell's first feature powered by deep learning suggests categories and titles for your listing, based on the images that you upload. Matt will explain how we train a joint model that predicts the category and ranks titles using a shared deep representation of images and natural language.

### Conversation Modelling (stepping stone to building an assistant) by Hoang Nguyen

Chat is the default feature to complete a deal on Carousell. Hoang will share how we're building a natural language conversation model to suggest replies to users as they chat. This is a stepping stone to building a personalized shopping assistant.

Speaker Bio

Matt got his PhD in statistical dialog systems from Steve Young's group at the University of Cambridge. He then worked on neural network methods for speech synthesis with Heiga Zen at Google Research London, before moving to Ray Kurzweil's language understanding group at Google Research in Mountain View. There he was technical lead for the Smart Reply research team, inventing a new method of modelling email response suggestion that allowed scaling the feature from Inbox to all of GMail. His goal is to develop intelligent conversational machines. ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-henderson-9a10b125/ )

Hoang has been with Carousell since its founding days. He graduated from National University of Singapore with a degree in Computer Science. He is currently working on solving problems using machine learning/deep learning and is passionate about AI personal assistants. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoang-nguyen-02274126/)

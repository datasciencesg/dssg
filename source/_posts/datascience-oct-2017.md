For October, we've a sharing on Music Composition using Neural Networks, by Ang Shen Ting from Wecash.

Also, Kammal Mannar and Hai Le from Accenture, will be adding a piece on their experiences with Deep Learning for large scale industrial applications.

### Music Composition using Neural Networks

Neural networks have been the rage in the past half decade, and have been successfully applied in speech recognition, image classification and medical diagnosis. However, the application of neural networks to the creative arts has been less hyped, with the most famous example being image generation using Deep Dream. What about music composition? This talk will explore various issues and considerations around applying neural networks to music, from data pre-processing, to design, to model evaluation.

Speaker

Shen Ting is a Data Product Manager with Wecash SEA. Previously, he was a data scientist with CureMetrix, Inc. and IDA (now GovTech). Shen Ting graduated with a MS in Computer Science from UC San Diego in 2016 and a BSc in Statistics from the Universty of Warwick in 2012. In his free time, Shen Ting sings with the Schola Cantorum Singapore Chamber Choir.

### Deep Learning in Action for Large Scale Industrial Applications

Advances in Deep Learning specifically on the image / video analytics capabilities is enabling us to develop new and differentiated capabilities for our clients. Deriving value from new data science capabilities require not just data science smarts but also ability to integrate the models into day-today operations and bring insights into the hands of the operators. Kammal and Hai will walkthrough some of the leading examples that they are developing in Singapore and applying globally in domains such as oil & gas, gaming industry, forestry etc.

Speaker

Hai, Le is a manager with Data Science Center of Excellence in Singapore. He has a PhD in computer science from NTU (Singapore) in remote sensing. Hai loves to analyze data to find patterns, and translate these into relevant and actionable insights for people to take actions in everydayâ€™s context.

Kamal Mannar leads the Data Science COE for Accenture in Singapore. He has more than 15 years of experience in bringing advanced innovation to manufacturing and operations across North America and APAC across industries such as energy, petrochemicals, healthcare, manufacturing, mining / oil & gas etc. In his current role as lead for Data Science COE he is responsible for innovation in the area of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics with leading clients in the region. He has a PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering from University of Wisconsin Madison and 4 granted patents, 6 pending applications and 6+ journal publications in application of analytics in areas such as healthcare, smart grid, precision agriculture etc
